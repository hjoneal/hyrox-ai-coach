To do this, go to the results website linked above, select the desired event and show the any result for that event. This will take you to list view with results. Next scroll to the bottom of the page and press the reload button. This will update the page url to include the event id for the selected event\n","\n","For example, carrying out the necessary steps for the Season 5 2023 Glasgow event results in the following url being shown - https://hyrox.r.mikatiming.com/season-5/?event=HPRO_JGDMS4JI439. The event id for this event would be 'JGDMS4JI439'. This id can then be inputted into the HyroxEvent class and all results will be scraped into a csv file.\n","\n","All events with their event ids that are already part of the dataset can be found
